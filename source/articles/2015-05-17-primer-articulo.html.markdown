OOOOO

You're in! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost
editor and get you started. Go ahead and edit this post to get going and learn
how it all works!

## Getting Started

Writing in markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply
write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use _formatting_
shortcuts to style your content. For example, a list:

* Item number one
* Item number two
  * A nested item
* A final item

or with numbers!

1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

## Links

Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like
[http://ghost.org](http://ghost.org/) - it'll automatically be linked up. But
if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to
[the Ghost website](http://ghost.org/). Neat.

## What about Images?

Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your
article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

![The Ghost Logo](http://tryghost.org/ghost.png)

Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a
descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the
image in to upload:

## Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said.
It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future
release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.
